#+TITLE: Code Commonplace Book

* What is this?
An easily forkable commonplace book for heavily-annotated
interesting code of all kinds, notes, and so forth, from the
enormous digital world in which we find ourselves.

* Table of contents
Perhaps some day a table of contents will go here.

* Why not use the GitHub wiki?
Because this should be a live, local document that anyone can add to
in their own little experimental world. That part of git is really
awesome.

Of course org-mode limits things to emacs. But it has great HTML
export (and thus should work for ebooks) and LaTeX support.

* TODO TODOS
- [ ] Figure out how to do a TOC and whether to keep renderings in the source.
- [ ] Maybe this is its own website? But then it's a project.
- [ ] Ride bikes.
